    Learning objectives assessed in this exercise:
        1. Functions, arguments, parameters, return values
        2. Array iteration
        3. Accessing object properties
        4. Using array methods
        5. Algorithmic thinking

  INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Write a function assigned to a variable named `extractLocations`.
    2. The function should accept any array of objects as input. Two
        arrays are provided for your use.
    3. The function should return an array of strings.
    4. The strings in the array should be extracted from the location
        property of each object in the input array.
