# Core JavaScript Syntax Assessment

## Setting Up

1. Click the Gitpod icon above. If requested, authorize with Github.
2. After the virtual machine is set up, a terminal will appear at the bottom of the editor.
3. Paste the command `serve -l 8088` into the terminal to start the web server.
4. A new browser window will open where the code is running.
5. Remember that this isn't `create-react-app` so you will need to manually refresh the running code when you make changes in the editor.

## Assessment

Open `main.js` and read the instructions contained therein. Remember to talk about your process, ask questions, and use your tools.
